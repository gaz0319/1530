# Sprint 3 Notes

- Deliver minimal Django backend that loads mock events from `data/events_sample.json`.
- Provide `/events/` JSON endpoint plus server-rendered landing page at `/`.
- Pair backend with standalone frontend (`frontend/index.html`) that fetches the same endpoint.
- Future sprints can extend the Django app with models for RSVPs, organizations, and real authentication.
